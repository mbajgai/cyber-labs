# 🧠 Cyber Labs by Manoj Bajgai

Welcome to my **Cyber Labs** — a personal collection of labs, notes, and hands-on exercises as I develop my skills in **Networking**, **Cybersecurity**, and **IT Infrastructure**.

I use this space to document real-world practice and continuous learning across networking, system administration, and ethical hacking fundamentals.

## 🔧 Focus Areas

- **Networking & Troubleshooting**
  - VLANs, subnetting, DNS/DHCP, Windows Server setup, and network monitoring tools.
- **Cybersecurity**
  - TryHackMe labs, HackTheBox challenges, vulnerability scanning, SIEM basics, and blue-team defence.
- **System Administration**
  - Windows and Linux management, backups, and security hardening.
- **Automation & Scripts**
  - Simple Bash and Python scripts for system checks and security automation.
