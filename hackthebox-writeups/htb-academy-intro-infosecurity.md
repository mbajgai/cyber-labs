# HTB Academy — Introduction to Information Security
**Date started:** 2025-11-07  
**Platform:** HackTheBox Academy  
**Module:** Introduction to Information Security  
**Progress:** [10% / 100%]  

## Objective
Gain a practical foundation in information security concepts, terminology, and defensive fundamentals to prepare for hands-on labs and beginner certs.

## Topics covered
- Threat types (malware, phishing, insider threat)
- Basic network security concepts (firewalls, VPNs)
- Authentication & access control basics
- Principles of confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA triad)
- Intro to common tools and workflows (nmap, Wireshark, logs)

## Practical work / exercises completed
- HTB Academy lab: [name of lab or exercise] — brief sentence on what you did
- Related TryHackMe rooms attempted: [room1], [room2] (links)
- Home lab used: VirtualBox with Kali + Windows VM (notes)

## Tools & commands I used
- `nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap_initial.txt <target>` — for initial enumeration  
- `tcpdump` / Wireshark — basic packet capture and inspection  
- Windows Event Viewer — log review

## Key takeaways
- Clear understanding of the CIA triad and how it maps to everyday admin tasks.  
- Learned how simple misconfigurations (open SMB, weak auth) create large risks.  
- Practical familiarity with basic network enumeration and log review procedures.

## Next steps
- Complete HTB Academy module (finish all lessons & labs).  
- Do 2 TryHackMe rooms that apply these principles and add write-ups.  
- Start CompTIA Network+ study (network fundamentals) and schedule exam planning.
